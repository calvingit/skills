# Context7 CLI Reference

Use these details when Context7 is the chosen documentation source. Execute in the current permitted environment; authentication and installation must follow the user's authorisation.

## Step 1: Resolve a Library

Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID and returns matching libraries.

```bash
npx ctx7@latest library React "How to clean up useEffect with async operations"
npx ctx7@latest library "Next.js" "How to set up app router with middleware"
npx ctx7@latest library Prisma "How to define one-to-many relations with cascade delete"
```

Use the official library name with proper punctuation (e.g., "Next.js" not "nextjs", "Customer.io" not "customerio", "Three.js" not "threejs"). If results look wrong, try alternate spellings such as `next.js` before changing the query.

Always pass a `query` argument — it is required and directly affects result ranking. Use the user's intent to form the query, which helps disambiguate when multiple libraries share a similar name. Do not include any sensitive or confidential information such as API keys, passwords, credentials, personal data, or proprietary code in your query.

### Result fields

Each result includes:

- **Library ID** — Context7-compatible identifier (format: `/org/project`)
- **Name** — Library or package name
- **Description** — Short summary
- **Code Snippets** — Number of available code examples
- **Source Reputation** — Authority indicator (High, Medium, Low, or Unknown)
- **Benchmark Score** — Quality indicator (100 is the highest score)
- **Versions** — List of versions if available. Use one of those versions if the user provides a version in their query. The format is `/org/project/version`.

### Selection process

1. Analyze the query to understand what library/package the user is looking for
2. Select the most relevant match based on:
   - Name similarity to the query (exact matches prioritized)
   - Description relevance to the query's intent
   - Documentation coverage (prioritize libraries with higher Code Snippet counts)
   - Source reputation as a retrieval-ranking hint only, not proof of official ownership
   - Benchmark score (higher is better, 100 is the maximum)
3. Confirm that the selected source belongs to the official project and matches the requested product/version. Scores and snippet counts do not prove authority.
4. If no suitable match exists, use official docs directly. Ask only when unresolved product ambiguity would change the answer.

### Version-specific IDs

If the user mentions a specific version, use a version-specific library ID:

```bash
# General (latest indexed)
npx ctx7@latest docs /vercel/next.js "How to set up app router"

# Version-specific
npx ctx7@latest docs /vercel/next.js/v14.3.0-canary.87 "How to set up app router"
```

The available versions are listed in the `library` command output. If the requested version is unavailable, report the mismatch. Do not silently substitute a nearby version; seek the official versioned docs or label any comparison as evidence from a different version.

## Step 2: Query Documentation

Retrieves up-to-date documentation and code examples for the resolved library.

```bash
npx ctx7@latest docs /facebook/react "How to clean up useEffect with async operations"
npx ctx7@latest docs /vercel/next.js "How to add authentication middleware to app router"
npx ctx7@latest docs /prisma/prisma "How to define one-to-many relations with cascade delete"
```

### Writing good queries

The query directly affects the quality of results. Be specific and include relevant details, but keep each query to one topic — if the question spans multiple distinct concepts, run a separate `docs` command per concept instead of combining them, unless the question is about how the concepts interact. Do not include any sensitive or confidential information such as API keys, passwords, credentials, personal data, or proprietary code in your query.

| Quality | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Good | `"How to set up authentication with JWT in Express.js"` |
| Good | `"React useEffect cleanup function with async operations"` |
| Bad (too vague) | `"auth"` |
| Bad (too vague) | `"hooks"` |
| Bad (too broad) | `"routing and auth and caching in Next.js"` |

Describe what to look up in the library's documentation, rather than the task to complete — vague one-word queries return generic results, and multi-topic queries dilute ranking and return shallow results for each topic.

The output contains two types of content: **code snippets** (titled, with language-tagged blocks) and **info snippets** (prose explanations with breadcrumb context).

## Authentication

Works without authentication. For higher rate limits:

```bash
# Option A: environment variable
export CONTEXT7_API_KEY=your_key

# Option B: OAuth login
npx ctx7@latest login
```

## Error Handling

If a command fails with a quota error ("Monthly quota reached" or "quota exceeded"):
1. Inform the user their Context7 quota is exhausted
2. Suggest they authenticate for higher limits: `npx ctx7@latest login`
3. Use accessible official documentation through the available browser/search tools. If current sources remain unavailable, report what could not be verified; do not present training knowledge as current documentation.

Do not silently fall back to training data — always tell the user why Context7 was not used.

## Common Mistakes

- Library IDs require a `/` prefix — `/facebook/react` not `facebook/react`
- Resolve with `npx ctx7@latest library` unless the user supplied a valid library ID; a bare name such as `react` is not an ID
- Use descriptive queries, not single words — `"React useEffect cleanup function"` not `"hooks"`
- One topic per query — split `"routing and auth and caching"` into a separate `docs` command per concept, unless the question is about how they interact
- Do not include sensitive information (API keys, passwords, credentials) in queries
